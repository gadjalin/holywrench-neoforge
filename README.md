Fantasy Description
------------------

Down in the dark and forgotten corners of Minecraft Vanilla, dwells a holy stick going by the name of "Debug Stick".
If you possess the strength and are deemed worthy of its grace (If you're OP and in creative), you may access ultimate power over your world and that of others!
Changing the shape of stairs and slabs, turning and spinning around pillars and logs, and even make furnaces appear lit without fuel or fences flooded without water.

This mod brings this power to ye, mere mortals. But with great power comes great responsibility, and so we made adjustments so that ye don't have to suffer the weight of these responsibilities.

Technical Description
------------------

This makes the debug stick available in survival through a (reasonably expensive) craft, and allows you to modify block states properties.
Simply left click on a block with the stick to select the property you wish to modify, and right click to cycle through the available states.

Said properties include blocks rotation, stairs and rails shape, fences and walls connections, and much more! But without breaking survival by preventing access to unrealistic/duplication prone states. For example, single slabs can be moved up and down, but not transformed into double slabs as would be possible if the stick were used in creative mode. In the same way, blocks cannot be made waterlogged, and the number of candles cannot be changed.
